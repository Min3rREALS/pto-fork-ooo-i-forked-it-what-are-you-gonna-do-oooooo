# Pizza Tower ONLINE
This is the source code of a very old mod for Pizza Tower's 2020 Western build, adding online and various other features.
We're remaking the mod in the form of [Pizza Tower: Cheesed Up!](https://discord.gg/thenoise)

It was left in a very unstable state between the April 2021 build and Eggplant (June 2022) build port process, because I gave up halfway through.
It's practically unplayable.

The online part of this game uses [GameMaker Server](https://gamemakerserver.com/).
This extension is at the end of its life (it will be shut down), and it was honestly horrible for making any actual gameplay.

# Don't fork
You do NOT have my permission to fork/clone this and make your own mod regardless of credit.
I've had this happen twice and both of them ended up having shitty people that started going against me.
"But it's open source!" you're still stealing my work if you use it for yourself.

Hi Bruj.
